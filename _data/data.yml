career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a self-taught Programmer with interests in Networks 
      and Network Security. Extremely motivated to continually develop my skills
      and grow professionally. I come across as an open-minded,
      fun-loving person to people, which helps me socialise well,
      but I believe I’m an ambivert. When it’s time, I
      shut everything up and get down to business.

      I believe to be a versatile learner with an eye
      for detailing. My curious nature makes me question each aspect
      and gain an in depth insight. This curiosity has helped
      me explore, poke it, question it and turn it upside down.
